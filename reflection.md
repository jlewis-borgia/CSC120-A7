- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

In the Cafe subclass, I overloaded the sellCoffee method twice so that you are allowed to input less information in a coffee order. The original has you enter the ounces of coffee, number of sugar packets, and number of creams you want. The first overloaded method assumes you want no cream, so you only enter the amount of coffee and number of sugar packets you want. The second overloaded method assumes you want no cream and no sugar so you only enter the amount of coffee you want.

In the House subclass, I overloaded the isResident method. Now, the original allows you to check if one person is a resident of a house while the overloaded method allows you to check if two people are both a resident of a house.
I also overloaded the moveIn method. Now, the original moves in a single resident and the overloaded method allows you to move in two residents at once. 

In the Library subclass, I overloaded the checkOut method. The original allows you to check out one book and the overloaded method allows you to check out two books at once. 
I also overloaded the returnBook method. The original allows you to return out one book and the overloaded method allows you to return two books at once. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think most of what I did worked for this assignment. I would say that I didn't have time to do the kudos part of the assignment. I would give the advice to start the assignment early.
